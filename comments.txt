Apollo Server enables us to connect a GraphQL schema to a server and can do other things too.
     --so this is the approach we would be taking
1-install appolo-server
2-install graphql and its type declaration
3-install express and body-parseur
4-install apollo-server-express
5- install mongodb and types declaration file -D
6- install dotenv and types declaration file -declaration
7- install lodash and type declaration file


1--apollo-boost @apollo/react-hooks graphql
2--@types/graphql --save
3-- no more use of src/lib folder after 8.2 client
4-- use the official Apollo CLI to generate static types from our GraphQL API. to prevent us from manuall doing it.
5-check package.json
6--no more use of custorm defined types in types.ts
